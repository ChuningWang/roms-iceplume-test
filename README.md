# roms-iceplume-test

This repo contains the documents to run all three experiments described in Wang et al. (2023) to be published in JGR: Oceans. All three experiments can be compiled in full analytical mode, thus do not require any additional files to run. Optionally, Ex3 can be run with grid and initial files in netCDF format. The T/S profiles for Ex3 are stored in ex3/data/KS2014_KS1_TS.mat, and a python script is attached to generate those netCDF files from the mat file.

Additional compile options can be found in https://github.com/ChuningWang/roms-iceplume.
